// How to Add Future Clickable Objects Bc Syrus Forgets- First create a SeaSideParanoia(Clue) in Unity
// 2nd assign a name for example the name is what's being called <<AddPage Missing_Person>>
// 3rd If making clickable make a new Object can make a prefab variant and such of the Victim in Scene 
// 4th Assign it the Clue and a branch to where it goes 
// That's how you make it 
// sets background image to sprite called "bg_office"
<<Scene Forest_BW>>
// start playing audioclip "ambient_birds" at 50% volume, loop forever
//<<PlayAudio PlaceHolder 0.5 loop>>
// Can Change volume by 0.5=50 0.20% and to loop just put loop at end 

Prologue
