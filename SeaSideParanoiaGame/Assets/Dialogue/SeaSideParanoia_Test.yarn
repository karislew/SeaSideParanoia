// How to Add Future Clickable Objects Bc Syrus Forgets- First create a SeaSideParanoia(Clue) in Unity
// 2nd assign a name for example the name is what's being called <<AddPage Missing_Person>>
// 3rd If making clickable make a new Object can make a prefab variant and such of the Victim in Scene
// 4th Assign it the Clue and a branch to where it goes
// That's how you make it
// sets background image to sprite called "bg_office"
<<Scene ForestScene_01>>
<<PlayAudio Birdchirp_bgm 1.0 loop>>
